# JSONAPI+OpenAPI
The `JSONAPIOpenAPI` framework adds the ability to generate OpenAPI compliant JSON documentation of a JSONAPI Document.

See the Open API Spec here: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md

*This library is in its infancy. The documentation will grow as the framework becomes more complete.*
